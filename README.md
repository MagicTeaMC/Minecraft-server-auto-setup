I don't use Windows anymore, so v2 is written in rust

If you want it to setup automantic, here is a command (If you are using Windows, please add .exe after the file name, like `./Minecraft-server-auto-setup.exe`):
```
./Minecraft-server-auto-setup --software=Paper --version=1.21.1 --eula=true
```
